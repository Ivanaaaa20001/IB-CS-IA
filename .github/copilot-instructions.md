# Copilot Instructions for IB-CS-IA

## Project Overview

This is an IB Computer Science Internal Assessment (IA) project developing an inventory management system using web technologies.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main entry point for the application (currently a placeholder)
- `settings/index.html` - Settings page for the application (currently a placeholder)
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `LICENSE` - MIT License

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **License**: MIT License

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow modern web development best practices
- Keep code simple and well-documented for educational purposes
- Ensure code is accessible and follows WCAG guidelines where applicable

### File Organization

- Place HTML files in appropriate directories
- Keep related assets organized by function
- Use clear, descriptive file names

### Documentation

- Document any complex logic or algorithms
- Include comments explaining the purpose of functions
- Keep the README.md updated with setup instructions and project progress

### Testing

- Test all functionality manually in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes
- Validate HTML and CSS when possible

### Best Practices

- Write clean, readable code suitable for academic assessment
- Consider the user experience and interface design
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep security in mind (input validation, XSS prevention, etc.)

## Academic Context

This is an IB Computer Science IA project, which means:
- Code should be well-documented and explained
- The development process matters as much as the final product
- Changes should be made with consideration for the assessment criteria
- Maintain clear commit history showing iterative development

## Notes for Copilot

- This is a student project, so prioritize clarity and learning over advanced optimization
- Suggest educational resources when relevant
- Consider the academic integrity requirements of IB assessments
- Help maintain good software development practices appropriate for the IB DP level
